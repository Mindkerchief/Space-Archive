          <p>
            The Pleiades are an example of an open star cluster — a group of stars that were all born around the same
            time from a gigantic cloud of gas and dust. The brightest stars in the formation glow a hot blue and formed
            within the last 100 million years. They are extremely luminous and will burn out quickly, with life spans of
            only a few hundred million years, much shorter than the billions of years our sun will enjoy.

          <p>
            The “Einstein cross” pattern comprises four images of a distant supernova created by the gravitational
            lensing
            of its light as it passed a distant galaxy within a cluster of galaxies on its way to Earth.In addition to
            giving us a closer look at the dynamics of distant supernovae, the team says that its discovery will help to
            improve our understanding of the distribution of dark matter in the lensing galaxy and galaxy cluster, as
            well
            as to test Einstein's general theory of relativity and measure the rate of cosmic expansion in the universe.

          <p>
            The quasar is known as RX J1131-1231 (RX J1131 for short), located about 6 billion light years from Earth.
            Using
            the gravitational lens, a high quality X-ray spectrum – that is, the amount of X-rays seen at different
            energies
            – of RX J1131 was obtained.
            The discovery that the black hole in RX J1131 is spinning at over half the speed of light suggests that this
            black
            hole has grown via mergers, rather than pulling material in from different directions.

          <p>
            The Teacup galaxy is dominated by a bulge and has an asymmetric structure with a shell-like structure and a
            tidal tail.
            The shell and tail are signatures of a recent merger of two galaxies. Dust lanes in the system are
            interpreted as a gas-rich merger.
            Several candidate star clusters were identified in this galaxy with Hubble Space Telescope images.
            Observations with the Gran Telescopio
            Canarias showed that the Teacup Galaxy has a giant reservoir of ionized gas extending up to 111 kpc.

          <p>
            81P/Wild (Wild 2) (Wild is pronounced vilt) is a small comet with the shape of a flattened sphere and
            measures about 1.03 x 1.24 x 1.71 miles
            (1.65 x 2 x 2.75 kilometers). It takes Wild 2 nearly six and a half years (6.41) to orbit the Sun once. Wild
            2 last reached perihelion
            (closest approach to the Sun) in 2016. Comet Wild 2 is known as a fresh periodic comet. Wild 2 orbits the
            Sun between Mars and Jupiter,
            but it did not always travel the course of its orbit here

            milky blur. It is located
            about 2,480,000 light-years from Earth; its diameter is approximately 200,000 light-years; and it shares
            various characteristics with
            the Milky Way system.The Andromeda Galaxy has a past involving collisions with and accretion of other
            galaxies.

          <h2><a href="/html/latestdummy.html">Comet Halley</a></h2><br />
          <p>
            Halley's Comet is arguably the most famous comet in history. As a "periodic" comet, it returns to Earth's
            vicinity about every 75 years,
            making it possible for a person to see it twice in their lifetime. It was last here in 1986, and it is
            projected to return in 2061.
            The comet, officially called 1P/Halley, is named after English astronomer Edmond Halley, who examined
            reports of a comet approaching Earth in 1531,
            1607 and 1682. He concluded that these three comets were actually the same comet returning over and over
            again, and predicted that it would return in 1758.
            Halley's calculations showed that at least some comets orbit the sun.

          <p>
            This object, called the Helix nebula, lies 650 light-years away, in the constellation of Aquarius. Also
            known by the catalog number NGC 7293, it is a typical
            example of a class of objects called planetary nebulae. Discovered in the 18th century, these cosmic works
            of art were erroneously named for their resemblance
            to gas-giant planets.Before the star died, its comets, and possibly planets, would have orbited the star in
            an orderly fashion. When the star ran out of hydrogen
            to burn, and blew off its outer layers, the icy bodies and outer planets would have been tossed about and
            into each other, kicking up an ongoing cosmic dust storm.

          <p>
            The northern lights, or the aurora borealis, are beautiful dancing waves of light that have captivated
            people for millennia. But for all its beauty, this spectacular
            light show is a rather violent event. Energized particles from the sun slam into Earth's upper atmosphere at
            speeds of up to 45 million mph (72 million kph), but our
            planet's magnetic field protects us from the onslaught. As Earth's magnetic field redirects the particles
            toward the poles — there are southern lights, too, which you
            can read about below — the dramatic process transforms into a cinematic atmospheric phenomenon that dazzles
            and fascinates scientists and skywatchers alike.

          <p>
            Europa may be the most promising place in our solar system to find present-day environments suitable for
            some form of life beyond Earth. Scientists are almost certain
            that hidden beneath the icy surface of Europa is a salty-water ocean thought to contain twice as much water
            as Earth’s oceans combined. And like Earth, Europa is thought to
            also contain a rocky mantle and iron core. There is very strong evidence suggesting Europa's ocean is in
            contact with rock.

          <h2><a href="/html/latestdummy.html">The Cat's Eye Nebula</a></h2><br />
          <p>
            The full beauty of the Cat's Eye Nebula (NGC 6543) is revealed in this new, detailed view from NASA's Hubble
            Space Telescope. The image from Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys
            (ACS) shows a bull's eye pattern of eleven or even more concentric rings, or shells, around the Cat's Eye.
            Each 'ring' is actually the edge of a spherical bubble seen projected
            onto the sky - that's why it appears bright along its outer edge. Observations suggest the star ejected its
            mass in a series of pulses at 1,500-year intervals. These convulsions
            created dust shells, each of which contain as much mass as all of the planets in our solar system combined
            (still only one percent of the Sun's mass).

            No response has been received from Opportunity since Sol 5111 (June 10, 2018), amid a planet-encircling dust
            storm on Mars. With the last uplink transmission on Sol 5352 (Feb. 12, 2019),
            the rover recovery efforts are concluded. The Opportunity mission is complete. The team will begin the
            project close out phase. A NASA press conference was held on Wednesday, Feb. 13, 2019,
            at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, to report on the end of the rover mission.
            Total odometry is 28.06 miles (45.16 kilometers).
